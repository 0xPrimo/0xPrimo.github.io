      <description>Executive Summary StrelaStealer is a Malware Stealer that has been out since 2022. it steals Outlook and Thunderbird credentials. StrelaStealer searches for &amp;ldquo;logins.json&amp;rdquo; (account/password) and &amp;ldquo;key4.db&amp;rdquo; (password database) within the &amp;ldquo;%APPDATA%\Thunderbird\Profiles&amp;quot; directory to acquire the credentials for Thunderbird. StrelaStealer seeks out the Windows Registry from where it can retrieve the program&amp;rsquo;s key and &amp;ldquo;IMAP User&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;IMAP Server&amp;rdquo;, as well as the &amp;ldquo;IMAP Password&amp;rdquo; values. Since the latter is kept in an encrypted form, the malicious program employs the Windows CryptUnprotectData feature to decrypt it prior to exfiltration.</description>

Since its emergence in early 2023, PikaBot appears to be in active development, with a new major version released in February 2024. The malware employs advanced anti-analysis techniques to evade detection and harden analysis, including system checks, indirect syscalls, encryption of next-stage and strings, and dynamic API resolving.</description>

      <description>Introduction While i was looking for a way to bypass UAC (User Account Control) i came across cmstp.exe which is a LOLBIN (Living of the land binary) that can be abused to bypass UAC and execute arbitrary commands through an auto-elevated COM interface.
Abusing CMSTP.EXE Running cmstp.exe with the following config will spawn an elevated cmd.exe.
[version] Signature=$chicago$ [DefaultInstall] RunPreSetupCommands=RunPreSetupCommandsSection [RunPreSetupCommandsSection] C:\Windows\System32\cmd.exe [Strings] ServiceName=&amp;#34;EVIL&amp;#34; ShortSvcName=&amp;#34;EVIL&amp;#34; Hurdle: User Options Box The issue is that the user must select All users option then click OK in order to spawn the elevated cmd.</description>
