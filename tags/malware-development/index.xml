&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;PikaBot is a malware loader, widely distributed since February 2023, that is used by Initial Access Brokers (IABs) to establish an initial foothold within a victimâ€™s networks and to distribute additional payloads such as Cobalt Strike and Meterpreter.
Since its emergence in early 2023, PikaBot appears to be in active development, with a new major version released in February 2024. The malware employs advanced anti-analysis techniques to evade detection and harden analysis, including system checks, indirect syscalls, encryption of next-stage and strings, and dynamic API resolution.&lt;/p&gt;
