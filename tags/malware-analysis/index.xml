      <description>Executive Summary StrelaStealer is a Malware Stealer that has been out since 2022. it steals Outlook and Thunderbird credentials. StrelaStealer searches for &amp;ldquo;logins.json&amp;rdquo; (account/password) and &amp;ldquo;key4.db&amp;rdquo; (password database) within the &amp;ldquo;%APPDATA%\Thunderbird\Profiles&amp;quot; directory to acquire the credentials for Thunderbird. StrelaStealer seeks out the Windows Registry from where it can retrieve the program&amp;rsquo;s key and &amp;ldquo;IMAP User&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;IMAP Server&amp;rdquo;, as well as the &amp;ldquo;IMAP Password&amp;rdquo; values. Since the latter is kept in an encrypted form, the malicious program employs the Windows CryptUnprotectData feature to decrypt it prior to exfiltration.</description>

      <description>Overview PikaBot is a malware loader, widely distributed since February 2023, that is used by Initial Access Brokers (IABs) to establish an initial foothold within a victimâ€™s networks and to distribute additional payloads such as Cobalt Strike and Meterpreter. Since its emergence in early 2023, PikaBot appears to be in active development, with a new major version released in February 2024. The malware employs advanced anti-analysis techniques to evade detection and harden analysis, including system checks, indirect syscalls, encryption of next-stage and strings, and dynamic API resolving.</description>
